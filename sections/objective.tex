My current work focused on building data analysis tools for use in Cosmology - designing statistical tools that take data from telescopes and output results that are useful to Physics. During my MPhil I developed a first-of-its-kind Bayesian anomaly detection methodology using numerical sampling techniques. Initially designed for RFI mitigation, we hope to use it to detect other anomalies in the future such as Fast Radio Bursts. Prior to that I developed a machine learning algorithm to classify malignant tissue during breast cancer surgery, which is currently being tested at NU Hospital.
