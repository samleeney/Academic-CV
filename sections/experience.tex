%====================
\subsection{{MPhil Project / Design of the Bayesian data analysis pipeline for the REACH telescope \hfill Jan 2022 --- Present}}
\subtext{Cavendish Astrophysics \hfill Cambridge, United Kingdom}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Using novel Bayesian inference techniques to detect the global 21cm signal.
\item My work is focused on designing radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation techniques for the telescope.
\item These techniques are the first-of-their-kind to take a Bayesian approach to RFI correction.
\item Our methadology has been submitted to the journal MNRAS for publication.
\end{zitemize}

% EXPERIENCE C
%====================
\subsection{{Extended summer research project / image segmentation techniques for breast cancer diagnosis \hfill June 2021 --- Dec 2021}}
\subtext{Nottingham University \hfill Nottingham, United Kingdom}
\begin{zitemize}
\item My work on this project (continued from my undergraduate thesis) was to design an image segmentation algorithm to generate sampling points for raman spectra analysis, providing a highly sensitive diagnosis on malignant tissue in intra-operative timeframes.
\item This was achieved using convolutional neural networks, which I designed based on the U-Net neural network.
\item These works are currently in preparation for publication. I will be named as the third co author.
\end{zitemize}
