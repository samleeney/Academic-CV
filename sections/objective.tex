% Objective Statement
%====================
My my academic career thus far has been focused on designing data analysis tools for Physics. I have been involved in two projects, one in radio cosmology and one in medical physics. The prior has been submitted to the journal MNRAS and I am the primary author. The latter is in prep and will be submitted to a medical physics journal, where I am coauthor. I also achieved a 1:1 degree in Physics at The University of Nottingham. In the future I hope to continue using novel machine learning and Bayesian inference techniques to solve complex astrophysical problems.
