My research focuses on developing machine learning tools and Bayesian methods for cosmological applications. I recently designed a machine learning-based radiometer calibration system for the REACH experiment, which aims to detect a faint, previously unseen signal from the early universe. In parallel, I am applying a Bayesian anomaly detection method—originally developed during my master's research—to refine supernova measurements and contribute to resolving the Hubble tension.
